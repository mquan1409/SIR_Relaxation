# SIR_Relaxation

SIR model has been one of the most prominent models to predict the development of a new epidemic. However, the system of ordinary differential equations behind the model cannot be solved explicitly due to the structural exponential nonlinearity involved in the transcendental equation for removals. Consequently, over the years various numerical solvers have been proposed to approximate this model. In this study, we propose a novel numerical approach employing the so-called relaxation procedure. This approach introduces a relaxation term that helps the scheme preserve the non-negativity property while capturing the global convergence. Ultimately, we present some numerical examples to verify the numerical performance of the proposed method. We also compare the numerical results with those obtained from the classical methods.

We have 3 tests:
- Test 1
- Test 2
- Test 3
